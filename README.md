## The Problem VPay Solves

Sending cryptocurrencies to wallet addresses can be a daunting task for many users, as they often have low confidence in the process. This leads to users sending a small amount as a test transfer and waiting for confirmation before transferring the entire amount. This process can result in wastage of gas and additional time to confirm the transaction. VPay solves this problem by eliminating the need for test transactions.

VPay also addresses the issue of users not having enough details about the wallet they are sending to. By presenting the wallet history and stats to the user, they can make a better decision about the genuineness of the recipient. This allows users to easily detect red flags such as hacker or bot accounts they don't intend to transfer to.

Finally, VPay addresses the challenge of bringing Web2 native users to Web3 by providing an interface on Telegram. This makes it easier for users to start sending and receiving cryptocurrencies and transition to Web3 more seamlessly.
